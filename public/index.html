          My name is Kristen and I am a student at UW. I have always enjoyed music
          and I am always looking for ways to find new music. In may of 2022 I came
          up with the idea to write down in depth reviews about a large variety of
          albums. I have done a couple of month since then and this is the official
          catalog of all of my ratings. Enjoy!
        </p>
