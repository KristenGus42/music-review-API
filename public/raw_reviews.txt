Review: Pretty solid, strong guitar. A few of the songs melded in the middle and I disliked the choruses a few of them. All the “fave” songs are incredibly solid and very much bringing the album up. I really like the heavy guitar and the electronic feel. It’s very much modern rock n’ roll.

Review: Very short, but all songs consistently good. No bad songs that I wouldn’t choose to listen to again. I like the lyrics of the songs and the way he writes is pretty interesting to me. It feels chaotic, humorous and intimate. The music itself is very catchy, and there are some fun hooks that get your head bopping. Overall, incredibly solid and catchy album.

Review: I liked it and it’s almost a 9, there were just one too many in there that I maybe wouldn’t listen to outside of this. I honestly think with a few more listens it could be a 9-10 it might just be first impression. I really like the style of the singers voice and the music is cool. Sometimes the guitar I wasn’t a fan of but majority of the time it was actually the music’s strong suit. Very unique yet classic at the same time - I liked it a lot and again I think the songs are ones that take a couple listens to click so the rating could easily be higher.

Review: I might need a few more listens and maybe the score would go up. Very short album, and it was less EP styled like other ones so short songs too. Short/repetitive songs but very very good. I love the variety in styles and just very well structured. I could feel the passion in each one, and just very solid rock. I just loved it, I always like the kind of sporadic high energy rock, and a lot of the songs were just boppy/catchy (like money Bopped).

Review:  Short songs, but always a bop. This one didn’t have any stand out “wow” songs it’s just a nice listen through. Cool vibes, though I didn’t like the lyricism too much, it was way more the music. I think all of the songs are great hw movie and a few of the standout ones I would choose to listen again. I think this is one that listens well on the first time. It’s that pop/R&B whatever vibe but I feel it has the substance I like.

Review: I think this is one that could improve its score on another listen. It wasn’t terrible but I think this sort of genre is not my vibe. It seems too Whiny/monotone at times for me, and at one point just sounds like the same song for 30 minutes straight. I did like two songs though and I wouldn’t be opposed to putting this sort of music on for very calm background, but overall it was not my favorite… though I will say I can tell that it’s good at what it’s trying to do. And I just don’t like what it’s goal is, but yeah. 
Edit: yeah no score decreased with more listens -  not my vibe

Review: This one was hard! Musically it’s a solid 8 overall - some strong songs but some of them j didn’t like as much. But the experience of listening has been my favorite of any of the other albums I’ve done. The only reason for this is that there is so much to think about with these songs - I’m not disagreeing or agreeing with the themes and sentiments by the singer it was interesting just having access to all his comments on genius lyrics and then listening to the songs. This album was a lot about self awareness and self improvement. It was cool to read about what he wrote his songs about and what he thought about the themes of the album. I really liked some of his points and others I’m still mulling over. The reason I didn’t give a 9+ is bc a lot of these songs I would never listen to for the music and a lot of my scores fell below an 8.

Review: Very close to an 8 but honestly most of the albums I give 8’s probably become 9-10s with a couple of listens. I see this one getting worse/staying the same with more which is why I have it a 7.5. J think the songs are all a bit too long for my liking, and most meld together and it just dragging on. Though I will say I did like a few of them and the songs are not overtly bad, they’re just not my thing and at times are kinda droning. But I will say the bass is great in a lot of the songs and I really liked the vibes of both dead roads and torn up.

Review: I think after a few more listens this defiantly moves to 9-10 territory. I really like this album, I think the percussion/back tracks are all unique and experimental. The horns/sorta jazzy back tracks(?) for some of them really worked. Just overall solid music that was experimental in the best way. The background vocals and distortions were always well placed. One thing is that a few of the songs could get slightly repetitive and long and two of the songs I really didn’t vibe with near the beginning - but overall great and I love it.

Review: Ok this was between a 8/7.5 and irs hard bc I reallyyy enjoyed the last one, kinda liked the second to last, and then wasn’t overly impressed for the first 3 or 4. I didn’t actively not enjoy it, but none of it POPPED until the last two. They’re all vibes and chill and I’d listen to the first half when doing homework or a task, but I only really connected with the last two. I plan on looking more into this artist bc this is a small sample and I really liked their top song. Overall solid and score can probably improve.

Review: Great album! Again could see it moving to more of a 9-10 with more listens but genuinely such a good album. A lot of the times when I’m listening one comment j always have is repetitive/too long songs and I think that’s just bc jd the way I do this (multiple albums back to back non stop - I get bored) - but even though all of these songs are pretty long (3-4 mins) they fill their time wonderfully. I was surprised by the lack of boredom also considering the lower energy of the album. Historically mellow albums make me kinda bored - but the way she crafted the Melodies and tunes of these songs are right down my alley. Just wonderful. I also liked the random BASS and distorted guitar moments they added in to the songs. Just such a strong album all around. The lack of a 9+ rating might be because not tooo many of the songs POPPED.

Review: ok I liked it but this is not my normal genre and j think j would need more listens to make it 8-9 but since this was pretty consistently 7.5-8 I gave a 7.5. I think there was nothing that POPPED out or bopped on the album. I’m not the biggest fan of the auto tuned/distorted voice used a lot but it was infact all consistent and very fair. I think it was just solid and consistent throughout - he is a great storyteller and I think he shows alot himself in his verses.

Review: Love loveee. I love his style, his voice is so chaotic and fun to listen to. I also think it was fun on the songs where he didn’t do the whole screaming thing it fully sounded like a different person so it was cool variety and the style of rapping was great. I respect the lyricism and anecdotes shared throughout the album and think it’s a genuine show of who he is. He also said in an interview apparently that he can rap over pans clinging and it junk he almost takes this as a challenge because a lot of the backtracks are bare and so I didn’t like a few of them but alot of the back tracks I did end up liking. Really great and I think the whole album offered good variety and never made me bored. Solid throughout. I love the chaotic manic sound of aunt it fun and dance in the water. 
Favorite moments:
in “lost” I like how he started two different verses comparing himself first to Kubrick and then to Spielberg but like in a cool rhyming comparison - like “I’m Kubrick with two bricks”

Review: I think I don’t have the patience for this entire album but every song 8+ I reallyyyy enjoyed which is why it got as high as 7.5. I think it just gets slow and boring for me at points with the instrumental interludes. I like the heavier songs way better. They are heavy on instrumental stuff but they aren’t exciting or cinematic like I normally like them. Plus I think the highs are too high for me to tolerate the lows on this one. I really like butterfly with bullet wings and every song that isn’t more grungy just isn’t as interesting for me.

beginning of as simple was cool - I liked how he played with the classic “simple as 123”
Nightmares are a cool theme in this album - he talks abt them I’m many songs

I totally relate to the point in alive, I simply become more myself at night.

Review:
Beats are fun very dancy
Was the rush thing a sample??
I like the drops in the second song like I think it faded in and out in a cool way 
Very repetitive and not many like layers
Bass in one of your girls slays - honestly reminds me of the early Conan 
Not a biggest fan of the chorus of one of your girls, I liked the single voice and bass but all the voices like together mehhhh - loveeee the “face card no cash no credit”
The lil boops sound like owl city
I’m my room set into the groove like well but also too repetitive that I took the points down a bit  
Not the biggest fan of the organ behind chorus shut 
The guitar at the end of still got it redeems it- in general lol instrumental interlude made it better at the end and more interesting 
Piano a better backing track for his lil melancholy tracks - feels more “reflective” than like annoying to me 
ARE THESE SAMPLES or am I being gaslit 
Mentioned album tittle in lyrics 
Sometimes we all just silly like that 
This is good hw music 
Ending instrumentals of songs always redeem the songs - like I think his beats are the driving force of all the songs so whenever they can just be alone it slays 
Saxxxx and chorus in last song slayyys
Kinda kindaaaa mid just bc it’s so repetitive and a lot of the songs are simpler with just a repetitive similar beat
