This project parses a raw text file from an iPhone to create a browseable interface to view all of the documented music reviews. All music reviews were written by me over the course of two years and were edited for the purpose of this website. Because of the time frame there is some inconsistency in the available data (for example in the beginning I did not document "favorite moments"). 

To start the backend server it is preferred to use express and nodemon. API documentation for the backend is available in the markdown file APIDOC.md.

Fully designed, documented and implemented by Kristen Gustafson.
This is a project completed for CSE 154, a course taken at the University of Washington.
